# Parakeet

Do you like Vue syntaxe? Like, when you open double brackets and use variables and stuff like that... Parakeet is the same thing. Not as cool but it can save you a lot of time (not really but bruh it's for the business- ðŸ‘€)

## Use it (please don't it's shit)

In `input/index.parakeet`, you have this weird looking double-parentheses expression. This is the parakeet syntax.

In `dataSet.json`, you have to insert a **key** and a **value**. The **key** is what you will call inside of the input file. Its **value** is what is displayed in the browser.

## What tech it uses?

- A WebSocket for the auto reload.
- `node:http` for the webserver.
- `node:fs` for parsing input, writing output and watch changes to reload the page.

That's it. (really, I think I reinvented the wheel)
